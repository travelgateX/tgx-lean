## Branches

All repos must have only two main branches:

- **```master```**  
  Is the main branch and single source of truth of what's in prod. All commits to the branch should be tagged as all of
  them correspond to a release.
- **```dev```**  
  Is the integration branch. Everything that is not in production but is already integrated, tested and ready to roll is here.
  It is called ```dev``` because all developed features must be merged here and not ```master```.

Work is **NEVER** done on ```master``` or ```dev```. They are done in several other branches of two (ephemeral) types:

- **Feature branches**  
  All development must be done in a dedicated branch. Never do development on ```dev``` and of course never on ```master```.
  **By feature we mean all development THAT IS NOT a direct consequence of fixing a production bug or an expedited development
  that must be pushed to production**. Git model allows for cheap repository branching, which in turn allow us to keep an integration
  branch free from the clutter of partial development commits. Once the "feature" is complete, we integrate on ```dev```.
  Feature branches must be named with the following convention ```ft-[ticket-number]-[short-description-lowercase-dash-spaced]```.

- **Hot fix branches**  
  **All development THAT IS a direct consequence of fixing a production bug or an expedited development that must be pushed to production** goes into a ```hot fix``` branch. Customer tickets are not necessarily hot fixes. There rule of thumb is to know how the work should be integrated. If it's work that has to be put in production ASAP, then it's a hot fix. If not, then it's a feature.

## Integrating work

- Repository starts with a ```master``` branch, which cannot be deleted or pushed to. It contains ```README.md``` and ```CONTRIBUTING.md```.
- ```dev``` branch is created from it.
- When starting a feature, create a branch from ```dev``` with the following convention: ```(team)-feat-(related-task-id)-(some-short-feature-description)```,
  for example: ```squirtle-feat-123345-add-top-destinations-cards-in-stats```.
- You can optionally create a pull request as early as you want. That allows you to start a conversation and active code review with your peers, to catch potential issues early.
- Whe feature is done and ready to be integrated to ```dev```, rebase onto ```dev``` to tackle any merge conflicts before integrating. This way,
  merge will be a fast-forward and commit history will remain clean. Also, you can squash non-important commits before merging.
- Merge pull request with ```dev``` branch.
- When ready to deploy, PR ```dev``` â†’ ```master```and merge, should be fast-forward too.
- When done, feature branches can be deleted remotely (and if you want, locally too).
- If there's a production bug that needs to be fixed, branch from ```master```, fix and PR to ```master``` and ```dev```.
- Make sure that all commits to master are tagged with release version.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Some Project Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [Some Project@github.com](mailto:Some Project@github.com).

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Some Project. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](https://github.com/Some Project/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* Check something.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#Some Project-and-packages) your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](https://github.com/Some Project/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Some Project, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Some Project otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Some Project command, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Some Project) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Some Project?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Some Project from [the releases page](https://github.com/Some Project/Some Project/releases).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?** Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of Some Project are you using?** You can get the exact version by running `Some Project -v` in your terminal, or by starting Some Project and running the `Application: About` command from the [Command Palette](https://github.com/Some Project/command-palette).
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **Are you running Some Project in a virtual machine?** If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?
* **Which [packages](#Some Project-and-packages) do you have installed?** You can get that list by running `apm list --installed`.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Some Project, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](https://github.com/Some Project/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#Some Project-and-packages) your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Some Project users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a [community package](#Some Project-and-packages).
* **Specify which version of Some Project you're using.** You can get the exact version by running `Some Project -v` in your terminal, or by starting Some Project and running the `Application: About` command from the [Command Palette](https://github.com/Some Project/command-palette).
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Some Project? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Some Project's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Some Project
- Enable a sustainable system for Some Project's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
