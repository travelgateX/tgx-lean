### Board Priorities or Swimlanes

Kanban swimlanes are lines that split horizontally a Kanban board into two or more parts. They are useful for all teams but prove to be extremely handy for larger teams that have to visualize not only their work stages but also the different types of tasks that flow through the work process. As a result, the Kanban board stays nicely organized, uncluttered with homogenous work and thus brings more clarity to the workflow.

We use swimlanes to divide our tasks in three categories:

- **Expedites**:  
  Tasks with a highest or high priority **with a business or customer impact**
- **Direct Value**:  
  Tasks that provide a direct customer impact upon delivered
- **Enablers**:  
  Any other task that does not provide a direct value but "enables" us to be more efficient. Usually enablers tasks a tech debt related.

Using swimlanes we can have a clear overview of priorities in a board.
