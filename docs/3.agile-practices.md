## Overview

Teams must adopt [Lean Development](https://www.planview.com/resources/articles/lkdc-principles-lean-development/) principles. Specifically:

- **Eliminate waste**:  
  Spacially time consuming and high resource tasks (eg: manual and repetitive work) that don't add value
  to the customer. Please do not confuse tech debt tasks as waste, because they are the total opposite:
  they are carried out to enable teams to eliminate waste.
- **Defer commitment**:  
  Not plan (in excessive detail) for months in advance
  Not commit to ideas or projects without a full understanding of the business requirements
  Constantly be collecting and analyzing information regarding any important decisions

## Must Follow Practices 

### Task Tracking

- Every task that takes longer than 40 minutes must be tracked.
- Optionally, every task that takes longer than 10 minutes should be tracked.
- Any other tasks must be followed through Slack or mail (trying to avoid mail as much as possible).

### Task Duration

Tasks should be sized in order to be able to finish them in less than 48hs for each stage. That does not mean all tasks
must be finished in that time frame, but it's a target goal.

### WIP Limits

Work in progress (WIP) limits restrict the maximum amount of work items in the different stages (kanban board columns) of the workflow. The implementation of WIP limits allows you to complete single work items faster by helping your team focus only on current tasks. If WIP limit is exceeded, the whole team must work together to unblock the cluttered tasks.

### Epics

An epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks. Epics can encompass multiple projects and teams, and can even be tracked on multiple boards. Epics are almost always delivered over a set of sprints.

- All Direct Value and Enabler tasks must be part of an epic. 
- We use versions ([Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)) to track releases within an epic.

### Measure

- **Lead Time**:
  Lead time is the period between a new task's appearance in your workflow (selected for development)
  and its final departure from the system (last stage before done).

- **Cycle Time**:  
  Cycle time begins at the moment when the new task enters “in progress” stage and somebody is actually working on it.

- **# Resolved/Unresolved Issues**:  
  Measured by span of iteration.
