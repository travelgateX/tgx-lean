## Overview

Effective communication is key to the success of any organization because:

- It builds trust
- Provides clarity and direction
- Drives problem solving
- Creates better relationships
- Increases engagement
- Improves productivity
- Promotes team building and a positive work culture

## Channels

These are our communication channels in order of importance

- **Direct verbal communication**:  
  Clear, straight to the point and usually eliminates ambiguity.
- **Slack**:  
  Preferred communication channel over email. One off topics and urgent matters.
- **JIRA**:  
  We track our tasks and any task related communication must be followed through it.
- **Mail**:  
  Used mostly externally. Try to avoid internally as much as possible.
- **Meetings**:  
  Keep to a minimum, to the point and always finished them with a review, actionables and responsibles for them.
